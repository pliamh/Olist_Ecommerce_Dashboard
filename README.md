# Olist E-Commerce — Freight & Pricing Mini-Project

This mini-project cleans Olist order-line data (Brazil), builds a simple baseline to predict freight cost, and publishes a Tableau dashboard.

### 🔍 Dashboard Overview
- **Top-left:** Average Freight Cost by Product Category  
- **Top-right:** Orders per Product Category  
- **Bottom-left:** Price vs Freight by Category  
- **Bottom-right:** Free-Shipping Orders by Category

### 🧹 Data Prep (Python)
Cleaned and exported in the notebook:
- [`notebooks/01_load_and_preview.ipynb`](notebooks/01_load_and_preview.ipynb)

Key steps:
- Merged orders, order_items, and products
- Translated/standardized categories
- Flagged free-shipping rows (freight_value == 0)
- Removed invalid zeros in price/freight; fixed tiny weight outliers
- Saved tidy output:
  - [`notebooks/data_processed/order_products_clean.csv`](notebooks/data_processed/order_products_clean.csv)
  - [`notebooks/data_processed/order_products_clean.parquet`](notebooks/data_processed/order_products_clean.parquet)

### 🧠 Baseline Model
- Features: price, category (one-hot), simple “order age” from purchase timestamp  
- Model: `LinearRegression`  
- Result: **MAE ≈ 7–8** (freight units) on hold-out split

### ⚙️ Reproduce (quick)
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib pyarrow
jupyter lab
# open and run: notebooks/01_load_and_preview.ipynb

### 🔎 Key insights (quick read)
- **Freight varies a lot by category.** Furniture/decor and garden tools run higher on average than books or small electronics.
- **Most orders aren’t free shipping.** A tiny share shows `freight_value = 0`, concentrated in a few sellers/categories (likely promos).
- **Price ↔ freight is only loosely related.** Heavier/bulkier categories push freight more than item price alone.
- **Baseline MAE ≈ 7–8** suggests simple features capture some signal, but there’s clear room to improve with distance/weight features.
